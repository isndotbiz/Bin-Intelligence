# Top 5 E-Commerce Attack Vectors

## 1. Card Testing / Carding Attacks

Card testing involves criminals using automated bots to validate stolen credit card data by making small transactions on e-commerce websites. These micro-transactions (often less than $5) are used to verify if a stolen card is active before making larger fraudulent purchases. Cards without 3DS protection are particularly vulnerable as there's no additional authentication step to block these automated attempts.

**Impact on E-Commerce:** High-volume, low-value transactions that result in chargebacks, increased processing fees, and damage to merchant reputation. Card testing often targets charity sites or digital goods merchants with minimal purchase friction.

## 2. Formjacking / Skimming

Formjacking involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into an e-commerce website's payment form to steal payment card information in real-time as customers enter it. Unlike physical skimming, this attack happens entirely on compromised website checkout pages, often through compromised third-party scripts or supply chain attacks.

**Impact on E-Commerce:** Complete compromise of customer card data, leading to significant brand damage, compliance penalties, and potential long-term revenue loss due to customer trust issues.

## 3. Account Takeover (ATO)

ATO attacks occur when criminals gain access to legitimate customer accounts on e-commerce platforms using credential stuffing, phishing, or social engineering. Once accessed, they exploit stored payment methods, use accumulated loyalty points, or make fraudulent purchases using the victim's profile and verified status.

**Impact on E-Commerce:** Fraud losses, customer service costs, reputation damage, and potential regulatory issues when personal data is compromised.

## 4. False-Positive CVV Acceptance

Some card issuers fail to properly validate CVV codes during the authorization process, allowing transactions to proceed even when incorrect CVV values are provided. This vulnerability nullifies one of the primary security mechanisms in e-commerce transactions, as any CVV input is accepted rather than just the correct one printed on the card.

**Impact on E-Commerce:** Significantly increased fraud risk as a key verification step becomes ineffective, leading to higher chargebacks and financial losses.

## 5. Cross-Border Fraud

Cross-border fraud exploits the complexity of international transactions and the disconnect between issuing banks and transaction locations. Criminals use stolen cards in countries different from where they were issued, taking advantage of weaker verification requirements and delayed fraud detection in cross-border transactions.

**Impact on E-Commerce:** Higher chargeback rates, increased processing costs, and complex dispute resolution, with conversion rates often suffering when legitimate cross-border transactions are declined due to risk models.
