# BIN Intelligence System - Replit Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The BIN Intelligence System is a comprehensive Python-powered fraud detection platform specifically designed for e-commerce protection. The system tracks, classifies, and analyzes exploited Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) using real-world data from verified sources.

### Current State
- **Version**: 2.3.0
- **Database Records**: 2020+ verified BIN records
- **Status**: Production-ready with full functionality
- **Last Updated**: July 4, 2025

### Core Purpose
Focused exclusively on e-commerce fraud detection, tracking three critical exploit types:
1. **card-not-present fraud** - BINs vulnerable to CNP transactions
2. **false-positive CVV validation** - BINs with weak CVV verification
3. **no-Auto-3DS support** - Cards lacking automatic 3D Secure authentication

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Gunicorn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 2020+ BIN records
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3 dark theme, Chart.js, vanilla JavaScript
- **APIs**: Neutrino API for real-world BIN verification
- **Data Sources**: Authentic fraud intelligence feeds only

### Key Components
- **main.py**: Core Flask application with API endpoints
- **models.py**: Database schema and SQLAlchemy models
- **bin_enricher.py**: BIN data enrichment using Neutrino API
- **neutrino_api.py**: API client for real-world verification
- **fraud_feed.py**: Analysis of public fraud intelligence sources
- **templates/no_tabs_dashboard.html**: Main web interface

### Database Schema
- **bins**: Core BIN data with issuer, brand, card levels, 3DS support
- **exploit_types**: Classification of vulnerability types
- **bin_exploits**: Association table linking BINs to exploits
- **scan_history**: Historical scan data and metrics

## User Preferences

### Communication Style
- **Tone**: Professional, technical, and concise
- **Language**: Clear explanations without excessive technical jargon
- **Response Format**: Direct and action-oriented
- **Feedback**: User prefers immediate confirmation of successful changes

### Development Preferences
- **Data Integrity**: Strictly authentic data sources only (Neutrino API)
- **UI/UX**: Dark theme with high contrast for better visibility
- **Functionality**: Focused on e-commerce fraud detection only

## Technical Decisions

### Data Source Strategy
- **Primary**: Neutrino API for all BIN verification
- **Secondary**: Public fraud intelligence feeds for initial discovery
- **Eliminated**: All synthetic, mock, or placeholder data
- **Verification**: Real-time API calls for data authenticity

### Security Approach
- **API Keys**: Environment variables for all credentials
- **Data Handling**: No logging of sensitive BIN information
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with proper backoff
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database**: Direct SQL queries for export operations
- **Pagination**: Server-side pagination with 200 records per page
- **Connection Management**: Fresh database sessions for reliability
- **Client-side**: Efficient sorting without server round-trips

## Deployment Configuration
